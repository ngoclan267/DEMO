# Copy installed packages from builder. Installing with --user (into /root/.local) and copying
# that across stages breaks once USER switches to a non-root account below — pip's --user
# install path is resolved per-user, so appuser would never see /root/.local's packages, and
# /root/.local stays root-owned (permission denied executing its console scripts). Installing to
# the system site-packages and copying that instead works regardless of which user runs the app.
